# Blockbench MCP Sample Project

This repository serves as a template or example of how to create a workspace which sets up the [Blockbench MCP server](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/blockbench-mcp-plugin/) for success.

> __Note:__ In this example repository, the MCP port in Blockbench is set to __`3000`__ and the endpoint is __`bb-mcp`__. These are the default values, but can be changed within the plugin's settings in Blockbench.

## Start Blockbench

Desktop version of Blockbench must be running in the background.

## IDE Setup Examples
